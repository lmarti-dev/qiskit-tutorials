    "# Grover's algorithm\n",

    "In this notebook, we'll have a look at Grover's famous unstructured search algorithm. The problem is quite straightforward: we have some function $f(|x\\rangle) \\to \\{0,1\\}$ and we know that for a unique $|\\omega\\rangle$, $f(|\\omega\\rangle)=1$, in all other cases $|x\\rangle \\neq |\\omega\\rangle \\iff f(|x\\rangle)=0$. The goal is to find $|\\omega\\rangle$ given access to $f$. This is a very general and common problem: we are looking for a single item in a list, and the item is identified by the function $f$. The surprising advantage of Grover's algoritm is that it finds $|\\omega\\rangle$ with high probability in $O(\\sqrt{N})$, (where $N=2^n$, and $n$ the number of qubits). \n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, you would expect that, in a list of $N$ elements, you need, in the worst case, to check the $N$ elements to find the desired item with certainty. Even if we expand this to probabilistic search, the quantum algorithm performs better: in the classical case, if we look at $N/2$ items, we have a $50\\%$ chance of finding the item. In no classical scenario could we have $>50\\%$ chance of finding our item by checking $\\sqrt{N} \\leq N/2$ items ($N\\geq 4$), if you don't know anything about the properties of $f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grover's algorithm also does not hinge on the Quantum Fourier Transform, which sets it apart from Quantum Phase Estimation based algorithm, such as Shor's and the like. That's another reason why it's a very nice algorithm to study.\n",

    "Let's implement Grover's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we work with the index of the bitstring, since every bitstring is also the binary representation of some integer. For example, $|10\\rangle = 0 \\cdot 2^0 + 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 2$ (don't forget the right-to-left ordering.) I've already written the function to get from an `int` to a bitstring, and vice-versa. \n",
