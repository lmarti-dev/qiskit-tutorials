You've seen that Clifford circuits can be effiently simulated; this is the Gottesmanâ€“Knill theorem. We want therefore to look into a kind of gate which provides not only the _magic_ (or non-stabilizerness) of quantum circuits, but also the the ability to create hybrid algorithms: parametrized gates.\n",

    "$R\\sigma_j(\\theta) = e^{i\\theta \\sigma_j}$, where $j=X,Y,Z$ (the Pauli matrices). It is reasonable to ask how to implement those, and luckily there's a closed form we can get from the power expansion of the exponential. Then, we have\n",

    "All good, then let's see how that works in qiskit. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create a single qubit, apply a Hadamard gate, and then apply the $RZ$ gate to see how that affects the evolution. Note that in Qiskit there's a $1/2$ factor in the argument, such that $RZ_{qiskit}(\\theta) = RZ_{normal}(2\\theta)$. The reason for that is the simplification of the $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ function when you express them in exponentials. We'll see that later.\n"
