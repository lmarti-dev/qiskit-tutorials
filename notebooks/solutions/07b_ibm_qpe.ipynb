    "In this notebook we're going to do just that with the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm, which we saw about three weeks ago. Since we stay in the Qiskit ecosystem, we'll be able to reuse a lot of code we've built before.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen last week, quantum computers usually suffer from noise. Here we'll be able to compare that directly with our noiseless experience in the original quantum phase estimation notebook.\n",

    "To motivate you perhaps a bit more, note that such hardware runs are actually quite hard. For example, a somewhat recent [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12372) (whose conclusions seem to be up for discussion, but that's another matter), ran Shor's algorithm -- whose crucial component is QPE -- on 10 qubits. So in this notebook we're not necessarily going for state-of-the-art results, but still something very much non-trivial.\n",
